Upgrading Camunda 8.5.4 to 8.6.6 requires careful planning to ensure compatibility and prevent disruptions. Below are the recommended steps:

1. Review the Release Notes
	•	Visit the official Camunda Release Notes for versions between 8.5.4 and 8.6.6.
	•	Pay attention to:
	•	Breaking changes.
	•	New features.
	•	Deprecated or removed features.
	•	Migration instructions, if provided.

2. Backup Everything
	•	Database: Create a full backup of the database(s) associated with Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, Optimize, and Identity.
	•	Configuration Files: Save copies of your custom configurations (e.g., application.yml or Helm values).
	•	Data Storage: Backup any persistent volumes (e.g., Elasticsearch data).
	•	BPMN Models: Ensure that all deployed models are backed up.

3. Check System Requirements
	•	Verify that your infrastructure meets the system requirements for Camunda 8.6.6, including:
	•	Java version: Ensure your runtime supports the required Java version (e.g., Java 17 for Zeebe).
	•	Kubernetes version: If using Kubernetes, confirm compatibility.
	•	Database version: Ensure the database version is supported.
	•	Elasticsearch version: Ensure compatibility with the Elasticsearch version used.

4. Prepare for the Upgrade

a. Helm Users
	•	Check the Helm chart repository for updated values between versions.
	•	Update the Helm repository:

helm repo update



b. Docker Compose Users
	•	Review changes in the docker-compose.yml file provided in the new version.
	•	Download the updated docker-compose.yml for Camunda 8.6.6 and compare it to your current setup for differences.

c. Custom Deployments
	•	Identify changes in configuration formats or required environment variables.

5. Upgrade the Components

a. Zeebe
	1.	Stop Zeebe services.
	2.	Replace the Zeebe container or binaries with version 8.6.6.
	3.	If you use Helm:

helm upgrade zeebe camunda/camunda-platform --version 8.6.6


	4.	Apply any required database migrations (check release notes for scripts or commands).
	5.	Restart Zeebe and monitor logs for errors.

b. Operate, Tasklist, Optimize, Identity
	•	Upgrade each component by:
	1.	Stopping the current version.
	2.	Replacing with the new version binaries, Docker images, or Helm configurations.
	3.	Applying any new configuration changes if needed.

c. Elasticsearch
	•	Ensure that the Elasticsearch version remains compatible with Camunda 8.6.6.
	•	If an Elasticsearch upgrade is required, do it before upgrading Zeebe.

6. Verify Compatibility
	•	Test Custom Configurations: If you’ve made custom configurations, verify they work with the new version.
	•	Plugins and Extensions: Ensure any plugins, exporters, or custom code is compatible with 8.6.6.

7. Test the Upgrade
	•	Deploy the upgraded version in a staging environment.
	•	Test end-to-end processes, BPMN deployments, and API integrations to identify issues.

8. Upgrade in Production
	•	Schedule downtime, if necessary.
	•	Perform the upgrade following the steps tested in staging.
	•	Monitor the system closely after the upgrade, checking logs and performance metrics.

9. Post-Upgrade Validation
	•	Validate:
	•	Existing process instances.
	•	New deployments.
	•	User interface functionality (Operate, Tasklist, etc.).
	•	Run smoke tests for critical processes.

10. Update Documentation
	•	Document the upgrade steps, changes made, and issues encountered for future reference.

By following these steps, you should be able to upgrade Camunda from 8.5.4 to 8.6.6 smoothly. Let me know if you need detailed help with any specific part!
